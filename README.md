# ZIF-CE-to-Dual-MicroSD-Adapter-for-iPod-Classic

Components Overview:
FC1307A: This will be the main controller.
Two MicroSD Card Slots: These will be connected for storage purposes.
PM25LQ512B: This is an SPI-based 512Kb Flash memory. AKA EPPROM
40-pin ZIF CE Connector: for connecting with iPod Classic Instead of 1.8" Toshiba HDD

1. FC1307A Pinout and Connections:
Power Supply:

Connect VCC and GND to power the FC1307A. Ensure stable 3.3V or 5V power supply depending on the specifications of the chip and peripherals.
MicroSD Card Slots (Slot 1 & Slot 2):

Use the SPI or SDIO interface on the FC1307A to connect the MOSI, MISO, and SCK lines.
Each slot needs a unique Chip Select (CS) pin to switch between them.
Slot 1: SPI (MOSI, MISO, SCK, CS1)
Slot 2: Same SPI lines, but a different CS (CS2).
PM25LQ512B (SPI Flash Memory):

This flash memory will also be connected via the SPI bus:
MOSI, MISO, SCK, and a dedicated CS3 pin.
Since you're using multiple devices on the same SPI bus (microSD cards and flash memory), each device will have its own CS line.

2. MicroSD Slot Connections:
Slot 1:

Connect to the SPI interface of FC1307A:
MOSI: Data line from microcontroller to SD card.
MISO: Data line from SD card to microcontroller.
SCK: Clock line.
CS1: Chip Select pin specific to Slot 1.
Slot 2:

Same connections as Slot 1 but with a unique CS2 pin to manage communication.
3. PM25LQ512B SPI Flash Memory:
Connect the flash memory through the same SPI bus:
MOSI: Data to flash memory.
MISO: Data from flash memory.
SCK: Clock.
CS3: Dedicated chip select for the flash memory.
4. 40-pin ZIF Connector (for HDD):
Since the ZIF connector will be used for an HDD, the key signals to connect will be for parallel ATA (PATA) communication. Here's how you can map the necessary signals:

PATA Communication:
Data Lines (D0-D15): These are the 16-bit data bus lines. Youâ€™ll need to connect these directly to the FC1307A (if it supports IDE/PATA communication).
Control Signals:
CS0 (Chip Select 0) and CS1 (Chip Select 1): Used to select the HDD's command block registers or control block registers.
IOWR (I/O Write) and IORD (I/O Read): Control the data flow to and from the HDD.
INTRQ: Interrupt request signal.
DREQ/DACK: For DMA transfers.
RESET: Hard drive reset line.
Ground (GND): Common ground connection.
Power (VCC): Usually 3.3V or 5V for ZIF HDDs.

Summary of Connections:
Power Supply:

Connect appropriate VCC and GND to power the FC1307A, HDD, microSD slots, and flash memory.
SPI Bus (Shared by all SPI devices):

MOSI, MISO, SCK: Common between microSD slots and PM25LQ512B.
CS Lines:
CS1: For MicroSD Slot 1.
CS2: For MicroSD Slot 2.
CS3: For the PM25LQ512B flash memory.
40-pin ZIF Connector (HDD):

Connect the necessary PATA communication signals, data lines, and control signals.
Ensure proper power supply (usually 3.3V/5V) to the HDD via the ZIF connector.
Next Steps:
PCB Layout: After completing the schematic design, proceed with the PCB layout, ensuring minimal signal interference, especially for high-speed lines like SPI and PATA data lines.
Signal Integrity: Add bypass capacitors near power supply pins to prevent noise in communication lines.
Testing: After fabricating the PCB, test the connections carefully to ensure all devices (microSD slots, flash memory, and HDD) are functioning correctly.
